# AI Pathfinder – Uninformed Search Algorithms with GUI

## Overview
This project implements six uninformed search algorithms in a grid environment with GUI visualization.

Algorithms implemented:
- Breadth First Search (BFS)
- Depth First Search (DFS)
- Uniform Cost Search (UCS)
- Depth Limited Search (DLS)
- Iterative Deepening DFS (IDDFS)
- Bidirectional Search

The system visualizes:
- Frontier nodes
- Explored nodes
- Final path
- Dynamic obstacle handling

## Features
- 20x20 grid environment
- Static wall in center
- Random dynamic obstacles
- Step-by-step animation
- Real-time GUI updates

## How to Run
1. Install Python 3.x
2. Run the file:

   python ai_pathfinder.py
